- pre compute skybox maps

High Priority:
- continue developing the editor
    - project selection screen
    - simple editor ui containing scene hierarchy and component view
    - ability to add objects to the scene

- embed default shaders into the binary using xxd (think about structuring them)
- load all compute shaders when the program starts, then activate them per scene

- see segfault with loading thread
- scene manager should be added
- script manager should be global
- add ability to buffer scenes
- add ability to switch scenes

Medium Priority:
- Multithreaded resource loading? (almost done)

Low priority:
- maybe find a better solution that stopping the app when minimized?
