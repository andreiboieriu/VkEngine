High Priority:
- continue developing the editor
    - project selection screen
    - simple editor ui containing scene hierarchy and component view
    - ability to add objects to the scene

- see segfault with loading thread
- do something about compute shaders, maybe attach them to the scene?
- compute manager and scene manager should be added
- script manager should be global
- add ability to buffer scenes
- add ability to switch scenes
- investigate PBR shaders

Medium Priority:
- Multithreaded resource loading?
- move related methods from VulkanEngine to VkDevice class
- make VulkanEngine a better interface
- remove wrappers to method calls from objects managed by the VulkanEngine class
(ex: getWindowAspect ratio), instead pass references of these objects to those that require them

Low priority:
- maybe find a better solution that stopping the app when minimized?
